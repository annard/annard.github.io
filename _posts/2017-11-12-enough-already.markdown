Today I have decided the waiting game is over. I will pack my bags, leave the boat to the mercy of the sea and return to the Netherlands initially.

Ever since the boat has gone back in the water I have been waiting for something. Which inevitably goes wrong and I need to wait for something else. Now that the boat is effectively stuck in Oban for the winter, I have tried to see if I can create a situation where I can find some decent work locally. Remote work is not going to work: I would kill my back programming in the boat, and I couldn't find any space where I could comfortably work around here. The college doesn't seem to be interested because I still haven't heard any peep from them.
Furthermore the situation inside the boat is getting worse with the engine being worked on, I have less and less space. My cutlery and plates etc are now on the other couch. The floor of the boat is covered by a dehumidifier and the heater and packed bed sheets and it is all starting to drive me over the cliffs.

So today I booked my flights to see some friends near London and then going to my parents near the end of the week. From there a new adventure will begin. I have to be back on the boat around the end of March to make sure she gets out of the expensive harbour, the summer rates start April 1 and they are not funny. I hope the boat doesn't deteriorate during the winter, but I can't be bothered to stay to prevent it...

In the meantime, I may not blog a lot but I leave you with this image (hint: open in a separate browser tab for maximum effect):<br/>
