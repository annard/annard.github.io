Welcome to the first page of my blog that is supposed to keep you informed about what's going on at the moment in my life. Especially since I do not like Facebook or other commercial web solutions outside of my control and email may be cumbersome to keep you informed, I hope this is an acceptable alternative.

So at the time of writing I have been in Scotland since the beginning of June and as the title explains, it is still raining. It has been raining a lot, a whole lot, an exceptionally large lot. I have not seen this much rain in such a period in my life!

Now it's pub time, so I will add more (historic and current) information over time...
