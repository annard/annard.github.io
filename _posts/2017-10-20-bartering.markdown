While I'm still working on the boat and waiting to get to a decision for a final place to stay for the winter, I can't really find the motivation to find work. But I do offer my computer expertise to local people and I managed to barter for some work on the boat that was done. Or with the people from the Wide Mouthed Frog for some food and drink. It was not my objective to get something in return but I gladly accept it. And the people I helped are very happy about the results! (It was Windows consulting mostly...)

It does help until I find work and some money will be getting in again!
