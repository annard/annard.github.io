Red red red, I only see red!

What is this exciting installment about? Definitely not ["Fun with flags" by Dr. Sheldon Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjzRbgxZXz8)! [We don't mind if you take some time to watch that video, it is rather funny. — ed.]

Welcome back to my new and bladder-bursting episode of "Red flag". Now what is this all about? Let me elucidate you! [Btw. moronic Australian English testers: that one was for you! — ed.]

Oleander was normally found on a mooring before I rescued her from certain death. [Not that she repaid him in kindness. — ed.] Therefore when it is windy and raining, water will not get through the air gaps of the companionway's washboards, since she'd turn bow into the wind. However, in a marina where the boat can't turn with the wind, I noticed that Scottish horizontal rain does get in and moreover can flood through the washboards and drip into the area underneath the sink where I store my cutlery. I have found the cutlery enjoying swimming lessons in these cases. And it is a pain to clean and dry everything. Also the wind can really get cold inside so something needed to be done.

I ordered up some canvas and turnbutton eyelets+washers to make a "red flag" that would match my sprayhood and would be fit for purpose to protect the interior of the boat in a marina. With the aid of Dorothy and Dave (where Dorothy did the sewing since I was afraid to break the sewing machine and did in fact manage to break a needle, Dave provided the pine wood and advice on how to hammer the eyelets+washers) I managed to make something that worked. [Although you did also manage to make a mistake in your measurements which meant that you had to use a bungie-cord to make things work as suggested by Dorothy since you didn't have enough space to screw in turnbuttons. — ed.]

Anyway, this is what it looks like:<br/>

It is easy to undo, and you could even use it when [running with the wind](http://www.metrolyrics.com/running-with-the-wind-lyrics-dave-dudley.html) to prevent the wind blowing into the cabin. Or to shield the sun from shining in, or a million other uses!

Also, even though it was a cold but beautifully sunny day, look what the night had brought:

And doesn't she look pretty despite being an absolute pain at the moment?
