Welcome back to my activities with boating. I have been absent for quite a while
but will retroactively fill in the big gap since my last posting!

The title of this one refers to the fact that about a year ago, after I
successfully managed to sail Oleander from Oban to Dublin where she is now
berthed, I got the same problem with the engine that I had in Scotland. Just
like in Scotland I was very fed up with her and due to some personal health
complications (all solved) I just ignored her for a while. However in August I
finally encountered a mechanic that found and fixed the problem so we're back in
business. With a twist as usual. But watch this space as I add more stories
going back (and forward!) in time.
