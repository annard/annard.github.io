title: "Changed the webcam to Dublin Bay"

The old webcam was still for Scotland but that is highly inaccurate since I'm
not sailing there anymore. Well sailing, it was more like sitting in the marina.
Anyway, I digress.

On my homepage you can now monitor Dublin Bay as seen from Dun Laoghaire
marina. Unfortunately, Poolbeg marina is not as sophisticated so this is all you
get for now. Enjoy!
