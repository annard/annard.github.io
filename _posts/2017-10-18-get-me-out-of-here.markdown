This post describes the trip I am looking for crew for. So I am currently in Dunstaffnage Marina near Oban in Scotland. And I would like to go to [Bowling Harbour](http://www.clydewaterfront.com/clyde-heritage/bowling-harbour--old-kilpatrick/bowling-harbour) near Glasgow where I want to stay for the winter. I want to leave as soon as possible depending on the weather window being favourable.

The reason I need 2 crew members for this trip is primarily for safety reasons but secondary for the [Crinan Canal](https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/canals/crinan-canal/) where you need to open and close the locks and bridges yourselves. A lot of fun to be had for everyone!

The sail to Crinan is the hardest because of tidal overflow areas around the [Gulf of Corryvreckan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Corryvreckan). With the proper weather and tidal planning we should be able to navigate through this without too many troubles.

We could make it to Crinan by first leaving for Puilladobhrain and anchor there for the night. Then early in the morning leave for Crinan (depending on tides) to try to get there early in the afternoon so we can get in the sealock. Then depending on the time of day we can already try to get as far as possible in the canal.
After we pass the canal at Ardrishaig it could either be a long day sail towards Greenock and then take it easy to get to Bowling. Or split it in two evenly busy days and find shelter for the night somewhere in between.

For Bowling Harbour we need to get there around +/- 2 hours High Water in the afternoon otherwise we can't get in! Both at Oban and Bowling are train and bus stations that connect to the rest of Scotland.

What does the boat look like you ask? Well, let's look at the exterior first:

We will sail with just the genoa and the engine, we can easily get there just by motoring if we have to. There are two comfortable berths available and we will have heating and plenty of food on board.
Contact me if you are interested and available within the next 2 weeks!

Fair winds!
